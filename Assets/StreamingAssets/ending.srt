00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,490
You've reached the bottom of the hill.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,030
Let's review.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,610
Velocity is how fast you move in a

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,010
direction.

5
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,990
Acceleration is how quickly that velocity changes.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,910
When acceleration keeps changing due to slope, friction

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,090
or turns, we call it variable acceleration.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,490
Great job.

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,870
You've just experienced physics in motion.

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:22,590
Literally.
