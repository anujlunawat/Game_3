1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,259
Back to a steep slope.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,628
Acceleration increases again and the car

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:05,879
gains speed quickly.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,449
This shows that in variable acceleration, the rate

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,759
of change of velocity keeps shifting.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,619
Sometimes fast, sometimes slow.
