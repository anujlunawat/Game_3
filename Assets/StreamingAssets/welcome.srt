00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,010
Welcome, driver. Today, we are going to explore rectilinear motion

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,270
with variable acceleration.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,370
Rectilinear motion means moving in a straight line.

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,490
But when acceleration keeps changing, things get interesting.

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,670
Look ahead.

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,830
You're going downhill.

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,430
Start your engine and let gravity do the

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,990
hard work.

10
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,270
Hit all the checkpoints before the clock hits

11
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:20,450
you.
