1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,770
See how your car begins to speed up?

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:03,930
That's acceleration.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,410
The rate at which your velocity or speed

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,130
changes.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,830
But notice something.

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,330
As the hill is steeper, gravity pulls your

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,270
car more strongly.

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,130
So acceleration increases.

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,250
You move faster and faster in a short

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:19,570
time.

11
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,470
That's because your acceleration is variable.

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,230
It changes with every part of the hill.
